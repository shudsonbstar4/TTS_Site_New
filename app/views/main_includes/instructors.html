            <h3>TJ Muehleman</h3>
            <p>TJ can usually be found in one of three places: chasing his dogs around the yard, figuring out how not to lose a finger with the new saw he got for Christmas, or sitting in front of his laptop coding the next billion dollar idea -- or, as is often for TJ, the next thousand dollar idea. A native Texan, TJ's been a working developer for over 15 years and loves helping new coders figure out what a for loop actually does. TJ is also Co-founder of We&amp;Co and Standard Code.</p>
