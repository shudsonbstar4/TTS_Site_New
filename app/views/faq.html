					<h3>Adults:</h3>
					<h4>
					<p>1) Do I need to have a background in tech or previous experience with programming to join one of your programs?</p>
					<p>~ Nope! Our courses are beginner focused. Know how to use a mouse and a keyboard? Ok, you&rsquo;re all good! We start with the basics and go from there. No previous experience or expertise required. </p>
					<p>2) What are you looking for in an ideal student for one of your programs?</p>
					<p>~ At Tech Talent South, we don&rsquo;t care too much about fancy resumes or where you went to school (or if you even went at all). We want students who are passionate, persistent, and ready to work hard to do something awesome with technology. With the right attitude, anyone can learn to code!</p>
					<p>3) I don&rsquo;t live in Atlanta. Could I still enroll in your program?</p>
					<p>~ Absolutely. We welcome students from all over the country and even all over the world. Our program lasts 8 weeks, and we are happy to help accepted students find short-term housing in the area.</p>
					<p>4) Do you offer any financing options for your programs?</p>
					<p>~ We recognize that our program is a big investment, and we certainly would not want to discourage promising students. That being said, we offer several financing options, which we are happy to discuss with you. Just shoot us an email or give us a call. We also have a limited number of scholarships for our youth code bootcamps. We believe every kid should learn to code!</p>
					<p>5) Do I need a computer to participate in one of your programs? Do I need a specific kind of computer?</p>
					<p>~ Yes, you do need a computer and we ask that you provide a MacBook (a Mac laptop). As a group, we need to be working on a consistent platform and environment to cover as much ground as possible in 8 weeks. If you have a Mac but it is on the older side, please check in with us, and we&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re good to go if accepted to our program.</p>
					<p>6) I just graduated or am still in school. Am I too young for your program?</p>
					<p>~ We don&rsquo;t have age requirements for our programs. No one is too young or too old to code. Some of the greatest tech success stories in the past decade have come from folks as young as their teens (umm&hellip;.hello&hellip;.Facebook).</p>

					<h3>Youth Camps</h3>
					<h4>
					<p>1) Sounds cool but it doesn&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;re in my city. Would you ever host a kids&rsquo; program here?</p>
					<p>~ Sure! We&rsquo;ve hosted kids&rsquo; camps all over the Southeast and are always open to new locations. Please email us at info@techtalentsouth.com and let us know where you are so that we can plan future session locations accordingly.</p>
					<p>2) Does my child need a computer to participate in one of your camps?</p>
					<p>~ Yes. We prefer students to bring their own laptops to class. If you do not have a computer available for use, please contact us at info@techtalentsouth.com and we may be able to arrange a loaner. We work off of a cloud-based development platform for our kids&rsquo; camps and will not need to install any new software.<p>
					<p>3) What will my child take away from the "Youth Code Bootcamp"?</p>
					<p>~ The goal of the "Youth Boot Camp" is to expose your child to what is possible with technology and to the web's most fundamental tools and programming languages. You should expect your child to leave with some basic programming skills, a new way of looking at the world and, more importantly, a sense of excitement and a hunger to learn more!</p>
					<p>4) Why should I (or my child) attend one of your programs?</p>
					<p>~ Because....the world is changing! Technology is playing an increasingly important role in almost every organization or business out there. Whether you intend to pursue a career in tech or not, early exposure to these skills and a fundamental understanding of how computers and the web work can make a world of difference. Plus, the truth is most educational institutions simply aren't teaching these fun and practical skills. Computer programming makes you think in a whole new way about how to solve problems and how to build businesses. Many of today's most successful tech entrepreneurs cite early exposure and access to computer programming as a major reason for their success later in life.</p>
					<p>5) Where are your camps held?</p>
					<p>~ We&rsquo;ve hosted camps all over the Southeast at awesome coworking spaces like Atlanta Tech Village, Industry Charlotte, and Mojo Coworking (Asheville). We want to make sure that we surround our students with not only awesome new skills but also awesome new people, companies, and ideas.</p>
